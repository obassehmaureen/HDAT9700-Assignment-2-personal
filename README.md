| Conceptual understanding          | 24/30            | You do a good job of explaining the context and the utility of interrupted time series. You could be stronger in explaining _why_ the mini pill makes a good control. I really like the way you thought about the analysis and the fact that the media coverage didn't line up with the change in trend observed in the data.               |
| Application of statistical method | 27/30            | Good EDA which is directly informing your modelling approach. Model specification is good. Nice counterfactual plots. The date of March 2015 is a bit arbitrary given that the downward trend starts form Nov 2014. March looks like a seasonal thing every year. I am not sure why but I guess it is the mechanics of dispensing, I doubt it has to do with mothers timing summer births.                |
| Interpretation                  	| 23/30            | Good interpretation for the main series. Ideally you would repeat this for the other models you've fitted. Most people argued that the media coverage did have an effect but I quite like your argument that there is something happening prior to that!               |
| Presentation                      | 5/10            | The structure of the report was ok, but in many ways fully understanding your analysis relied on the long narrative appendix which doesn't quite meet the brief. I would expect the main modelling results to be included in the body of the report  for example. All your figures and tables should have proper titles and numbers.                |
| Overall                           | 79/100           |                |
